Websites can stand out for a number of reasons. Perhaps the website is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. Another website may be more cluttered, but makes up for this with great content. Some websites have been around for a long time and people have come to trust them to deliver a good experience.

One of my favorite websites is [Amazon][amazon]. Amazon has certainly made a name for itself as a safe and reliable online vendor. It has good content - more reviews than any other similar website. It may not have a beautiful design or an intuitive layout, but it gets the job done. Purchasing items is easy after Amazon saves all your information - too easy sometimes. And because of the multitude of vendors and variety of purchasing options, I rarely have buyer's remorse because I know I got a good price.

Another one of my favorite websites is [Google Maps][google-maps]. Nowadays we take online mapping and direction services for granted, but Google Maps offers some additional features that other mapping services do not, including Street View, biking directions, and transit directions. The design of the interface is simple and user-friendly. The web app is also full of good content, incorporating reviews of businesses from Yelp and satellite imagery.

The free online encyclopedia, [Wikipedia][wikipedia], is also a fantastic website. Content is king at Wikipedia, a website which allows users to write and edit articles freely. This freedom means that the content may also be dubious, but Wikipedia usually warns the user when a certain article is contentious or lacking information. The layout and design of Wikipedia reminds me of a newspaper because of its simple layout and colors. The abundant links to other articles make the site easy to navigate. The user experience is focused around the article, and it is easy to overlook the navigation bar on the side while roaming around Wikipedia.

In general, while user experience design is important, the content of the website is ultimately what users come for. The best websites combine both interesting content and a user-friendly interface.
