Dev Bootcamp focuses a lot on pair programming and exchanging feedback. Every week throughout Phase 0 of the program we are expected to pair at least twice with others in our cohort.

As a result, I’ve learned a lot about working with people. Up until now I’ve usually worked alone on personal projects and school assignments. I like working alone because of the control I have over the final product and because of the flexibility that comes with not having to coordinate schedules with someone.

But pair programming has so far been mostly a positive experience. Many times I’ve learned new tricks and methods while pairing. Many times pairing is the fastest way to overcome a roadblock in a challenge.

On the other hand, there have been times while pairing that I was silently hoping to finish up a challenge alone. I think it’s natural that we get along and work well with some people, but just don’t “click” with others. That’s why giving feedback is important. It forces you to identify what it was that was bothering you in the pairing session and express it kindly in your feedback.

I’ve learned that I work best with a pair who is engaged with the challenge and has her own ideas about how to tackle it. I’d rather work with someone who is pushy than apathetic. At least if my pair is pushy, I can push back and we can have a productive discussion regarding the best route to take.

I’ve learned that people also work at different paces. Some of us like to power through and get to the solution quickly, and some of us like to think things through and create more slick and elegant solutions. When you’re in a hurry to complete something, working with someone who likes to take their time can be frustrating. The inverse is also true.

Giving and receiving feedback has been a learning experience as well. While giving feedback I try to be honest and not pretend that something that was bothering me wasn’t bothering me. I do so because I hope that others will also give me their honest feedback as well. Looking at feedback from others, I sometimes think that it is a bit too diplomatic and it could benefit from some more directness.

Overall, I think pairing and doing feedback has been just as much of a learning experience as the actual coding itself. I’ve learned that I need to articulate more of what I’m doing/thinking, and I’m thankful for that feedback.
