JavaScript has its beginning with the Netscape Navigator browser. Back then the web was composed of mostly static websites, and Netscape wanted to make Java applets easier for designers to incorporate into websites.

It was considered by many to be fundamentally lacking. It didn't have many important developer features that were available with other programming languages, such as a debugger. The code had to be tested in the browser. It was easy to implement, which meant that a lot of inexperienced designers could easily copy and paste scripts for flashy, annoying features.

However, the language also had a lot of potential. It could be used not only to include Java applets, but also to manipulate objects on websites. It allowed for such features as changing images when a user clicks on them (which sounds basic now, but was very novel back then).

Not surprisingly, other companies came up with their own versions of JavaScript in an effort to compete. Microsoft responded with something called VBScript. Nevertheless, Netscape's JavaScript ended up being the most widely used.

Since then, JavaScript has seen many improvements and increased functionality. The great thing about JavaScript are that it allows for creating dynamic webpages without much difficulty once you know the basics. It is also compatible with all major browsers without many discrepancies in performance between browsers; this is because there have been significant initiatives to standardize JavaScript, such as by ECMA in 1996-1997.

Still, JavaScript has some limitations. JavaScript code on a website is publicly viewable which means it is difficult to maintain of your intellectual property. It also doesn't have very elucidating error messages and will let you get away with many unintended things without giving an error. But JavaScript is clearly here to stay, and it continues to be an indispensible language for web designers nearly 20 years after its creation.
