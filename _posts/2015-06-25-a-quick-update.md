A lot has happened since I last posted. I started the blog in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp and stopped writing when I began Phase 1, primarily because there was little time as the program ramped up. I feel like I've learned a great deal from the experience, and I was able to find my first tech-related job as a web developer at L2T Media within 3 months. It’s a good entry level position where I get to learn some system administration and improve my web development skills.

I’ve also been building some sites for friends and family on the side. This is the new website I designed for [Leader Builders Corp](http://leaderbuilders.com/) and this is a template-based website I put together for [Groupt](http://www.groupt.me/) (running on Sinatra). The website I’m most proud of continues to be my final project from Dev Bootcamp called [Belief Mapper](http://www.beliefmapper.com/) (built with Ruby on Rails in 8 days with a team of 4). It's a sort of evolution from the [value-finder](/cultural/2014/09/21/the-value-finder.html) that I wrote back in Phase 0.
