Social psychologist Claude M. Steele has for many years been studying the underperformance of minority students. He has coined the term stereotype threat to help explain why minority university students tend to underperform in comparison to white students - even when their standardized test scores for admissions were equivalent.

Stereotype threat refers to an anxiety that comes from a fear of being judged and of reinforcing negative racial stereotypes by doing poorly on an exam. This anxiety, whether conscious or not, increases the pressure to perform and reduces the ability to focus.

Surprisingly, in studies, something as small as a statement that the test-to-be-administered is “racially fair” or is not going to be used as an assessment of intellectual capacity was often successful in equalizing test scores.

How can knowledge about this problem be applied? Trust is an important factor. When people trust that their performance will not be assessed in the context of race, anxiety from stereotype threat and underperformance tend to disappear.
