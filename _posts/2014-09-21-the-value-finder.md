This week I put together a small Ruby program to help determine my most important values. Each question asks you to choose between two different values, like so:

- Wisdom (A) or Integrity (B)?
- Courage (A) or Accountability (B)?
- Meaningful work (A) or Security (B)?

The winners of each question move up in rank and are then pitted against the other winners. At the end, the program prints out all the values in order from the most important to the least important.

Here were my top 25% most important values out of a total of 96 words (in no particular order):

{% highlight javascript %}
Meaningful-work,   Helping-society,   Personal-development,   Insight,
Freedom,   Economic-security,   Health,   Ambition,
Growth,   Achievement,   Challenge,   Justice,
Independence,   Wisdom,   Self-reliance,   Autonomy,
Truth,   Excellence,   Self-knowledge,   Nature,
Knowledge,   Cooperation,   Fairness,   Openness
{% endhighlight %}

Self-knowledge is important to me because I believe that we are often influenced by personal biases and ideologies that we may not even be aware of. Great ideas come from stepping out of old modes of thinking, but to do this we must be aware of our biases and be willing to rethink our own assumptions.

Wealth was the last topic that someone had asked my advice on. The advice I gave my friend regarding investing in the stock market was to invest long-term in strong companies that will likely continue to grow. Tesla Motors, despite large gains in stock price over the last 2 years already, is a company that still has a lot of momentum, I think.*

Thinking about and ranking my values has been a helpful exercise. It helps me clarify what I stand for. Iâ€™m thinking of making this little application available online, but, at the moment, I don't know how to do that.

*At the time of writing, TSLA is at $259.32.
