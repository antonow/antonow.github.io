Anthony Gregoric is a researcher and author who developed a model of how people think with four basic categories:

- Concrete Sequential
- Abstract Sequential
- Concrete Random
- Abstract Random

The concrete-abstract distinction refers to whether a person engages primarily with perceptual stimuli, the content of the 'here and now'¬ù (concrete), or with concepts and ideas (abstract).
The difference between sequential and random is that a person scoring highest in sequential likely prefers to think linearly, follow step-by-step instructions, and plan for the future. The random thinker prefers to work non-linearly, starting in the middle, and going with the flow rather than making plans.

Of course, no one falls entirely within one of these categories. We all use these different strategies in different situations. There is a test designed to show you which combination you typically employ. The test can be found [here][personal-think].

I scored highest in the Abstract Sequential category. It seems fitting. I tend to try to think things through in an orderly way and discover the assumptions underlying my arguments. I think this focus on the logical will be very helpful at Dev Bootcamp when trying to solve challenges because coding requires this kind of attention to detail and ability to engage with abstract objects. What may be more difficult to me is working with people who don't think the way I do. I am a relatively opinionated person.

I want to also bring up briefly the Fixed vs. Growth mindset distinction that we've already been asked to consider several times in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. I think it's important that people understand not only the evidence for the growth mindset (neuroplasticity), but more importantly the benefits of believing that your intelligence is not fixed. If you think that you are naturally smart, you won't try as hard. You will probably feel very personally hurt when you fail at something. If you think that you inherently aren't as clever as other people, you may never really try to change that.

I think there are no smart or dumb people. There are only those people who work hard to learn from every experience and others who think that learning and growing is pointless because other people always will be smarter or dumber than they are. Of course, not trying is the best way to find yourself left behind.By staying in the growth mindset, you'll be too busy tracking your own progress to be constantly comparing yourself to others.

Growing your mind means constantly pushing yourself to try new things and learn new things. Simple activities like taking a different route when you go for a walk around the neighborhood or trying new recipes while cooking can help you to practice thinking in different ways. Learning a new language is more work, but also  more effective in training your brain.

Dev Bootcamp, in its curriculum, sometimes brings up the advantages of meditation and the ability of daily meditation to reshape the brain in positive ways. This is also something that I'm always trying to do more of. Recently, I downloaded the [Headspace app][head-space], and I am using it to do 10 minute meditations every day.
