Anthony Gregoric is a researcher and author who developed a model of how people think with four basic categories:

- Concrete Sequential
- Abstract Sequential
- Concrete Random
- Abstract Random

The concrete-abstract distinction refers to whether a person engages primarily with perceptual stimuli, the content of the 'here and now'¬ù (concrete), or with concepts and ideas (abstract). The difference between sequential and random is that a person scoring highest in sequential likely prefers to think linearly, follow step-by-step instructions, and plan for the future. The random thinker prefers to work non-linearly, starting in the middle, and going with the flow rather than making plans.

Of course, no one falls entirely within one of these categories. We all use these different strategies in different situations. There is a test designed to show you which combination you typically employ. The test can be found [here][personal-think].

I scored highest in the Abstract Sequential category. It seems fitting. I tend to try to think things through in an orderly way and uncover the assumptions underlying my beliefs. I think this focus on the logical will be helpful at Dev Bootcamp when trying to solve challenges because coding requires this kind of attention to detail and ability to engage with abstract objects. What may be more difficult to me is working with people who don't think the way I do.

I want to also bring up briefly the Fixed vs. Growth mindset distinction that we've already been asked to consider several times in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. A fixed mindset means you believe you are smart or dumb and you can't do anything to change that. The growth mindset assumes that there is no smart or dumb, skilled or unskilled. There is just the place that you are at along the learning timeline/continuum and only through continued learning will you move forward.

Growing your mind means constantly pushing yourself to try new activities and learn new things. Simple activities like taking a different route when you go for a walk around the neighborhood or trying new recipes while cooking can help you to practice thinking in different ways. Learning a new language takes longer, but is also more effective in training your brain.

Dev Bootcamp, in its curriculum, sometimes brings up the advantages of meditation and the ability of daily meditation to reshape the brain in positive ways. Recently, I downloaded the [Headspace app][head-space], and I am using it to do 10 minute meditations every day.
