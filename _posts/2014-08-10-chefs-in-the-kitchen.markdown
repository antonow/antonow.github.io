A big reason why I gravitated toward Dev Bootcamp rather than other programs was the emphasis on developing the soft skills. I think that some people who are drawn to programming tend to be more logical thinkers, and sometimes that focus on the logical side can lead to a lack of attention to the emotional/social side.

If I wanted to simply learn the technical skills, I could complete online courses. It would probably take significantly longer and take a more meandering route, but I could probably build a little portfolio and find a job. However, I also wanted to work with people and improve my communication skills. So I am excited that Dev Bootcamp puts extra attention on this sometimes neglected aspect.

I think that, for me, the engineering empathy part of the curriculum will be more difficult than the technical skills because I am an introvert and it takes me some time to open up to people. I am nervous, but this is an opportunity to practice these skills while learning to become a programmer also.
