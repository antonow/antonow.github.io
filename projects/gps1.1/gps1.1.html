            <h2> What is pair programming? </h2>
            <p> Pair programming is the process of working with another person to complete a challenge. The advantages of pair programming include: both people being able to learn from eachother and having multiple perspectives makes troubleshooting much easier. Also, working with others better prepares you for a real work environment in which you are expected to work with coworkers and clients.</p>

            <h2> Compare Driver and Navigator </h2>
            <p> Driver: The person at the keyboard that is primarily in charge of translating the pair's ideas into working code.</p>
            <p> Navigator: The person in the group that dictates the ideas and helps guide the driver.</p>
            <p> While there are two separete roles, the two work together and help with each task. They are both equally important in completeing the project.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p> Pairing is helpful because we both learned from each other today. There were some things that John knew that I didn't and vice versa.</p> 
            <p>It worked particularly well when the objective was clear - for example, when we knew that we wanted to do four boxes in two separate columns. When there was no clear objective, we were stalled for a bit.</p>
