  			<h3>Comparing Websites</h3>
  			<p>8/10/14</p>
  			<p>Websites can stand out for a number of reasons. Perhaps the website is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. Another website may be more cluttered, but makes up for this deficit with great content. Some websites have been around for a long time and people have come to trust them to deliver a good experience.</p>

			<p>One of my favorite websites is Amazon. Amazon has certainly made a name for itself as a safe and reliable online vendor. It has good content - more reviews than any other similar website. It may not have a beautiful design or an intuitive layout, but it gets the job done. Purchasing items is easy after Amazon saves all your information - perhaps too easy. And because of the multitude of vendors and variety of purchasing options, I rarely have buyerâ€™s remorse because I know I got a good price.</p>

			<p>Another one of my favorite websites (or web apps) is Google Maps. Nowadays we take online mapping and direction services for granted, but Google Maps offers some additional features that other mapping services do not, including Street View, biking directions, and transit directions. The design of the interface is simple and user-friendly. The web app is also full of good content, incorporating reviews of businesses from Yelp and satellite imagery.</p>

			<p>The last website I will talk about is the free online encyclopedia known as Wikipedia. Clearly, content is the central focus of Wikipedia, which allows users to write and edit articles freely. This means that the content may also be dubious, but Wikipedia usually warns the user when a certain article is contentious or lacking information. The layout and design of Wikipedia reminds me of a newspaper because of its simple layout and colors. The abundant links to other articles make the site easy to navigate. The user experience is focused around the article, and it is easy to overlook the navigation bar on the side while roaming around Wikipedia.</p>

			<p>In general, while user experience design is important, the content of the website is ultimately what users come for. The best websites combine both interesting content and a user-friendly interface.</p>

  			<h3>Chefs in the Kitchen</h3>
  			<p>8/10/14</p>
  			<p>A big reason why I gravitated toward Dev Bootcamp rather than other programs was the emphasis on developing the soft skills - working well with others, interacting honestly, empathy, etc. I think that many people who are drawn to programming tend to be more logical thinkers, and sometimes that focus on the logical side can lead to a lack of attention to the emotional/social side. I know that I myself have some work to do.</p>

			<p>If I wanted to simply learn the technical skills, I could do online courses. It would probably take significantly longer and take a more meandering route, but I could probably build a little portfolio and find a job. But I also want to work with people and improve my ability to communicate effectively. So I am excited that Dev Bootcamp puts extra attention on this sometimes neglected aspect.</p>

			<p>I know that, for me, the engineering empathy will be more difficult than the technical skills because I am an introvert. Starting conversations has never been my strong suit. I am nervous, but here is an opportunity to practice these skills while working on becoming a programmer also. </p>
