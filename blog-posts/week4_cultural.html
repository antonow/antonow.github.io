  			<h3>The Education Problem</h3>
  			<p>8/31/14</p>
  			<p>This past Thursday, I went to an open house at Dev Bootcamp to hear Griffin Caprio speak about “Why our industry sucks and we need you to fix it!” Griffin has worked in the industry for about 20 years in a variety of different positions and companies and so is well qualified to identify the most concerning trends in the tech industry.</p>

			<p>Griffin touched on a variety of different issues, such as diversity and special treatment which breeds laziness. But one of the most interesting issues he brought up I think was the education problem.</p>

			<p>Nearly everyone who works in the industry had to learn from experience. There is no clear path for people who want to be programmers or software engineers. You have to be a very self-motivated person to learn many things on your own and get a job in which you will likely still feel as if you know nothing.</p>

			<p>Because of this, every generation of programmers starts in a sense from the bottom or beginning. Wouldn’t the industry grow and improve more quickly as a whole if there were a way to teach newcomers what it took the veterans many years to learn?</p>

			<p>Dev Bootcamp and other similar programming bootcamps seem to be the first institutions trying to address these issues. As Griffin mentioned, even a computer science degree doesn’t really prepare you for work in the industry. There's more of a focus on academic pursuits that are simply not that practical for most of the kind of jobs that exist.</p>

			<p>I think Dev Bootcamp is an important step towards creating paths into the tech industry, but that it would be nice to start earlier. Microsoft pays employees to take time off to teach tech to kids in school, but it’d be nice if more companies took such an approach. In fact, everything from elementary school to higher education could use some restructuring. Instead of having school be primarily lecture based and centered around memorizing information, kids should be thought to think critically, and to engage in dialogue. These are the kinds of skills that can be applied to careers in tech.</p>
