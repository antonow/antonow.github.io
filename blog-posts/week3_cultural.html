  			<h3>Learning Styles and Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</h3>
  			<p>8/24/14</p>
  			<p>Anthony Gregoric is a researcher and author who developed a model of how people think with four basic categories:
  			<ul>
				<li>Concrete Sequential</li>
				<li>Abstract Sequential</li>
				<li>Concrete Random</li>
				<li>Abstract Random</li>
			</ul>

			The concrete-abstract distinction refers to whether a person engages primarily with perceptual stimuli, the content of the “here and now” (concrete), or with concepts and ideas (abstract).</p>

			<p>The difference between sequential and random is that a person scoring highest in sequential likely prefers to think linearly, follow step-by-step instructions, and plan for the future. The random thinker prefers to work non-linearly, starting in the middle, and going with the flow rather than making plans.</p>

			<p>Of course, no one falls entirely within one of these categories. We all use these different strategies in different situations. There is a test designed to show you which combination you typically embody, which can be found <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">here</a>.</p>

			<p>I scored the highest in the Abstract Sequential category. It seems fitting considering that I enjoy engaging more with texts and ideas than with more pragmatic concerns and emotions. I also tend to try to think things through in an orderly way, and I am interested in grounding my arguments in difficult-to-dispute basic assumptions.</p>

			<p>I think this focus on the logical will be very helpful at Dev Bootcamp when trying to solve challenges because coding requires this kind of attention to detail and ability to engage with abstract objects.</p>

			<p>What’s going to be more difficult to me is working with people who don’t think the way I do. I am a relatively opinionated person and I like to work very sequentially. If someone else prefers to work by skipping around more often we will probably have a harder time coordinating our efforts, but I’m sure we can make it work with proper communication.</p>

			<p>I want to also bring up briefly the Fixed vs. Growth mindset distinction that we’ve already been asked to consider several times in Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. I think it’s important that people understand not only the evidence for the growth mindset (neuroplasticity), but more importantly the benefits of believing in it - believing that our intelligence is not fixed. If you think that you are naturally smart, you won’t try as hard. You will probably feel very personally hurt when you fail at something. If you think that you are naturally not as clever as other people, you’ll never really try to improve yourself.</p>

			<p>I think it’s important to keep in mind that there is no real smart-dumb distinction. There are only those people who work hard to learn from every experience because they know that only by trying and occasionally failing they will become better. And there are other people who think that learning and growing is pointless because other people always will be smarter or dumber than they are. Of course, not trying is the best way to find yourself left behind in the dust. So it’s best to remember to stay in that growth mindset where you’ll be too busy tracking your own stellar progress to be constantly comparing yourself to other people.</p>

			<p>Growing your mind means constantly pushing yourself to try new things and learn new things. Simple activities like taking a different route when you go for a walk around the neighborhood or trying new recipes while cooking can help you to practice thinking in different ways. Learning a new language is much more work, but also much more effective in training your brain. I’m going to make an effort to learn more Japanese while attending Dev Bootcamp. It is unlike any other language I’ve learned before because I’ve studied Spanish (romance language) and Polish (slavic language). English is a Germanic language, so I figured I could exercise myself by trying to learn an Asiatic language.</p>

			<p>Dev Bootcamp, in its engineering empathy curriculum, also brings up the advantages of meditation and the ability of daily meditation to reshape the brain in positive ways. This is also something that I’m always trying to do more of. Lately, I downloaded the Headspace app and using it to do 10 minute meditations every day.</p>
