  			<h3>The Value Finder</h3>
  			<p>9/21/14</p>

			<p>This week I put together a small Ruby program to help determine my most important values. Each question asks you to choose between two different values, like this:</p>

			<pre>Wisdom (A) or Integrity (B)?<br>Courage (A) or Accountability (B)?<br>Meaningful work (A) or Security (B)?</pre>

			<p>The winners of each question move up in rank and are then pitted against the other winners. At the end, the program prints out all the values in order from the most important to the least important.</p>

			<p>Here were my top 25% most important values out of a total of 96 words (in no particular order):</p>

			<pre>Meaningful-work   Helping-society   Personal-development   Insight<br>Freedom   Economic-security   Health   Ambition<br>Growth   Achievement   Challenge   Justice<br>Independence   Wisdom   Self-reliance   Autonomy<br>Truth   Excellence   Self-knowledge   Nature<br>Knowledge   Cooperation   Fairness   Openness</pre>

			<p>Self-knowledge is particularly important to me because I believe that we are always entrenched in personal biases and ideologies that taint our perceptions in ways that we aren’t aware of. Great ideas come from stepping out of old or current modes of thinking. But to do this we must be aware of our biases and be willing to rethink our most basic assumptions.</p>

			<p>Wealth, although not on my list of top values, was the last topic that someone had asked my advice on. The advice I gave my friend regarding investing in the stock market was to invest long-term in strong companies that will likely continue to grow. Tesla Motors, despite large gains in stock price over the last 2 years already, is a company that still has a lot of momentum, I think.*</p>

			<p>Thinking about and ranking my values has been a helpful exercise. It helps me clarify who I am and what I stand for. I’m thinking of developing my program further and making it available online. At the moment, my knowledge of Ruby on Rails or Sinatra is too limited to let me to do justice to the idea of how I would like it to be. I’ll post a link when I eventually do get it up and running.</p>

			<p>*At the time of writing, TSLA is at $259.32.</p>
