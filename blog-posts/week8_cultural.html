  			<h3>Dealing with Conflict</h3>
  			<p>9/28/14</p>

			<p>This week, the topic I am supposed to write about is an emotional conflict that I’ve had with someone. I usually avoid conflict at all costs, so I don’t have a very exciting story to tell. But I did have a friend recently release a secret of mine that could’ve had disastrous consequences.</p>

			<p>Fortunately, the possible misfortune that it could have caused was avoided, and so I found myself able to eventually forgive him. But, for a while, I never brought up how he had wronged me and so harbored a little anger whenever I saw him.</p>

			<p>I waited until my anger had entirely subsided and finally told him. On the one hand, the waiting helped ensure that I wouldn’t create an angry outburst. But, if I could go back, I would have confronted him earlier. I learned that holding onto anger only hurts one’s self and doesn’t do anything for the other person.</p>
