			<h3>Let’s Talk About Stereotype Threat</h3>
  			<p>9/13/14</p>

			<p>Social psychologist Claude M. Steele has for many years been studying the underperformance of racial minority students. He has coined the term stereotype threat to help explain why minority university students tend to underperform in comparison to white students - even when their standardized test scores for admissions were equivalent.</p>

			<p>Stereotype threat refers to an anxiety that comes from a fear of being judged and of reinforcing negative racial stereotypes by doing poorly on an examination. This anxiety, whether conscious or not, increases the pressure to perform and reduces the ability to focus.</p>

			<p>Surprisingly, in studies, something as small as a statement that the test-to-be-administered is “racially fair” or is not going to be used as an assessment of intellectual capacity was often successful in equalizing test scores.</p>

			<p>How can we apply our knowledge about this problem? Trust is an important factor. When people trust that their performance will not be assessed in the context of race, anxiety from stereotype threat and underperformance tend to disappear.</p>

			<p>If we want to bring about change, we need to start with our own microcosms. For me at Dev Bootcamp, this means helping foster a welcoming and cooperative environment. In terms of giving feedback, it means maybe adding a disclaimer to constructive criticism. “I know it may seem that I’m being somewhat critical here, but please understand that I’m critical with everyone because I want to help everyone improve."</p>
