  			<h3>Asking the Right Questions</h3>
  			<p>10/5/2014</p>

			<p>What are questions? We all seem to know intuitively what they are. They are an articulation of something we don’t know, and, simultaneously, a request for assistance in finding an answer.</p>

			<p>Good questions target that which the asker knows that they do not know. There is a certain humility involved in asking good questions. You say, “This part I understand, but this, to me, is still confusing."</p>

			<p>Bad questions betray to the listener the asker’s ignorance of their own ignorance. I remember attending a lecture about the differences between transcendental and hermeneutic approaches to phenomenology, which went completely over my head, but at least I had the good sense of not asking any (probably) stupid questions. Another student, however, asked a totally incoherent question (regarding something about Jim Morrison and acid) that had nothing to do with anything that had been said. Even I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed for her.</p>

			<p>Bad questions are vague, confusingly put, and, at worst, completely incoherent. Good questions are the opposite. They demonstrate to the listener that the asker has studied the problem, isolated an impasse in their understanding, and articulated exactly what that is. Many times, in the process of narrowing down a question to formulate a good one, the question answers itself!</p>

			<p>I’ll end with several suggestions for formulating good questions.</p>

			<p>1. Do research first! Don’t waste people’s time asking questions that you can easily answer yourself.</p>
			<p>2. Be specific.</p>
			<p>3. Be humble. Be honest about what you don’t know. Don’t pretend to know more than you do because you might get a highly technical answer that presumes you already know the fundamentals.</p>
