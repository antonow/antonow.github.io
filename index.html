			<h3>What are SQL Injection Attacks?</h3>
  			<p>9/20/14</p>
			<p>Many website databases are created and maintained using Structured Query Language (SQL). Websites often allow users to access particular information from the database. A simple web application could take a users input and use it to make a database query, like in this Ruby example:</p>

			<pre>def print_reps_from_state(state)<br>  puts "#{state} REPRESENTATIVES"<br>  output = $db.execute("SELECT name FROM congress_members WHERE location = '#{state}'")<br>  output.each { |rep| puts rep }<br>end</pre>

			<p>$db.execute(…) takes the user’s input (state) and uses it to make a query to the database. If the user is knowledgeable in SQL, they could pass in an input containing an SQL command to give them more access to the database then was intended by the person putting together the website. They may be able to view all the records in a table, add new records, and alter or delete records.</p>

			<p>This all happens because the user’s input is passed directly into the SQL query ("SELECT name FROM congress_members WHERE location = '#{state}’") where it says #{state}. The only way to prevent an SQL injection attack is to never directly pass in a user’s input into the query.</p>

			<p>The user’s input must be sanitized to make sure that it does not contain any code that might expose the database to an attack. Rather than try to test the input for all the known SQL injection attack techniques, it’s easier to verify that the input doesn’t have any more characters or symbols than it needs.</p>

			<p>For example, if we are asking the user for an email, we would make sure that it does not contain any spaces or other characters that aren’t allowed in an email address. Better yet, we could ping the email address to verify it exists. Only after we have verified that the input provided by the user is safe should we use it to do a query to the database.</p>

			<p>So what’s the only way to prevent SQL injection attacks? Never directly pass in a user’s input to an SQL query. Always make sure that if you are going to use a user’s input in a query that the input does not contain any potentially dangerous code.</p>

  			<h3>The Value Finder</h3>
  			<p>9/21/14</p>

			<p>This week I put together a small Ruby program to help determine my most important values. Each question asks you to choose between two different values, like this:</p>

			<pre>Wisdom (A) or Integrity (B)?<br>Courage (A) or Accountability (B)?<br>Meaningful work (A) or Security (B)?</pre>

			<p>The winners of each question move up in rank and are then pitted against the other winners. At the end, the program prints out all the values in order from the most important to the least important.</p>

			<p>Here were my top 25% most important values out of a total of 96 words (in no particular order):</p>

			<pre>Meaningful-work   Helping-society   Personal-development   Insight<br>Freedom   Economic-security   Health   Ambition<br>Growth   Achievement   Challenge   Justice<br>Independence   Wisdom   Self-reliance   Autonomy<br>Truth   Excellence   Self-knowledge   Nature<br>Knowledge   Cooperation   Fairness   Openness</pre>

			<p>Self-knowledge is particularly important to me because I believe that we are always entrenched in personal biases and ideologies that taint our perceptions in ways that we aren’t aware of. Great ideas come from stepping out of old or current modes of thinking. But to do this we must be aware of our biases and be willing to rethink our most basic assumptions.</p>

			<p>Wealth, although not on my list of top values, was the last topic that someone had asked my advice on. The advice I gave my friend regarding investing in the stock market was to invest long-term in strong companies that will likely continue to grow. Tesla Motors, despite large gains in stock price over the last 2 years already, is a company that still has a lot of momentum, I think.*</p>

			<p>Thinking about and ranking my values has been a helpful exercise. It helps me clarify who I am and what I stand for. I’m thinking of developing my program further and making it available online. At the moment, my knowledge of Ruby on Rails or Sinatra is too limited to let me to do justice to the idea of how I would like it to be. I’ll post a link when I eventually do get it up and running.</p>

			<p>*At the time of writing, TSLA is at $259.32.</p>
