			<h3>Why Uses Classes</h3>
  			<p>9/6/14</p>
			<p>The most popular programming languages nowadays are object oriented programming (OOP) languages. What characterizes OOP is the focus on organizing code into objects that, in a way, represent real world objects. For example, we could have a class called Player and create player “objects” that would be instances of the Player's class.</p>

			<pre>class Player<br>	@@count = 0<br><br>	def initialize(species, stamina)<br>		@@count += 1<br>		@species = species<br>		@stamina = stamina<br>	end<br>	def eat(food_item)<br>		stamina += food_item.nutrition<br>		puts “Mmmm, yummy.”<br>	end<br>end<br><br>joJo = Player.new(“human”, 70)<br>qiQi = Player.new(“alien”, 90)</pre>

			<p>What this type of organization allows us to do is to easily add new players with unique attributes and also make universal changes to the properties of all individual players at once.</p>

			<p>Classes represent the general category that includes all the different objects that belong to that category. If you like Plato, classes are like the Platonic forms from which all the particulars derive their attributes.</p>

			<p>All objects in OOP are instances of some class and inherit the features of that class. In our example, any new player is going to inherit species and stamina attributes from the Player class.</p>

			<p>Another major benefit of using classes is encapsulation. Encapsulation means that variables and methods defined within an object or a class are self-contained and do not interfere with any variables and methods that have been defined elsewhere in the program. Classes make sharing and borrowing code much easier. Sites like <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org">www.phpclasses.org</a> require uploading code as classes so that the borrowed code doesn’t affect the rest of the code in a project when you try to incorporate it.</p>

			<p>Finally, when people write about the benefits of OOP, they usually mention polymorphism. I understand polymorphism as a quality of code that makes it usable across different types of objects. I know that sounds quite nebulous, so I’ll try to illustrate with an example.</p>

			<p>In my earlier example, I could call the eat method on any instance of the Player class. Now, I want to also have animals in my game which will, like players, also have the ability to eat, but they won’t be able to articulate their pleasure derived from eating by saying “Mmmm, yummy.” The solution? I can make another class called Animal and write an eat method that will increase stamina without the remarks. The ability to call the eat method on instances of both the Animal and Player class and have each produce a different but appropriate effect is what is called polymorphism.</p> 

			<p>So if you intend to share your code with the community, to incorporate others’ code from online, or even just to have nicely organized and compartmentalized code I recommend using classes.</p>

  			<h3>Pairing and Feedback</h3>
  			<p>9/7/14</p>

			<p>Dev Bootcamp focuses a lot on pair programming and exchanging feedback. Every week throughout Phase 0 of the program we are expected to pair at least twice with others in our cohort.</p>

			<p>As a result, I’ve learned a lot about working with people. Up until now I’ve usually worked alone on personal projects and school assignments. I like working alone because of the control I have over the final product and because of the flexibility that comes with not having to coordinate schedules with someone.</p>

			<p>But pair programming has so far been mostly a positive experience. Many times I’ve learned new tricks and methods while pairing. Many times pairing is the fastest way to overcome a roadblock in a challenge.</p>

			<p>On the other hand, there have been times while pairing that I was silently hoping to finish up a challenge alone. I think it’s natural that we get along and work well with some people, but just don’t “click” with others. That’s why giving feedback is important. It forces you to identify what it was that was bothering you in the pairing session and express it kindly in your feedback.</p>

			<p>I’ve learned that I work best with a pair who is engaged with the challenge and has her own ideas about how to tackle it. I’d rather work with someone who is pushy than apathetic. At least if my pair is pushy, I can push back and we can have a productive discussion regarding the best route to take.</p>

			<p>I’ve learned that people also work at different paces. Some of us like to power through and get to the solution quickly, and some of us like to think things through and create more slick and elegant solutions. When you’re in a hurry to complete something, working with someone who likes to take their time can be frustrating. The inverse is also true.</p>

			<p>Giving and receiving feedback has been a learning experience as well. While giving feedback I try to be honest and not pretend that something that was bothering me wasn’t bothering me. I do so because I hope that others will also give me their honest feedback as well. Looking at feedback from others, I sometimes think that it is a bit too diplomatic and it could benefit from some more directness.</p>

			<p>Overall, I think pairing and doing feedback has been just as much of a learning experience as the actual coding itself. I’ve learned that I need to articulate more of what I’m doing/thinking, and I’m thankful for that feedback.</p>
