			<h3>The Education Problem</h3>
  			<p>8/31/14</p>
  			<p>This past Thursday, I went to an open house at Dev Bootcamp to hear Griffin Caprio speak about “Why our industry sucks and we need you to fix it!” Griffin has worked in the industry for about 20 years in a variety of different positions and companies and so is well qualified to identify the most concerning trends in the tech industry.</p>

			<p>Griffin touched on a variety of different issues, such as diversity and special treatment which breeds laziness. But one of the most interesting issues he brought up I think was the education problem.</p>

			<p>Nearly everyone who works in the industry had to learn from experience. There is no clear path for people who want to be programmers or software engineers. You have to be a very self-motivated person to learn many things on your own and get a job in which you will likely still feel as if you know nothing.</p>

			<p>Because of this, every generation of programmers starts in a sense from the bottom or beginning. Wouldn’t the industry grow and improve more quickly as a whole if there were a way to teach newcomers what it took the veterans many years to learn?</p>

			<p>Dev Bootcamp and other similar programming bootcamps seem to be the first institutions trying to address these issues. As Griffin mentioned, even a computer science degree doesn’t really prepare you for work in the industry. There's more of a focus on academic pursuits that are simply not that practical for most of the kind of jobs that exist.</p>

			<p>I think Dev Bootcamp is an important step towards creating paths into the tech industry, but that it would be nice to start earlier. Microsoft pays employees to take time off to teach tech to kids in school, but it’d be nice if more companies took such an approach. In fact, everything from elementary school to higher education could use some restructuring. Instead of having school be primarily lecture based and centered around memorizing information, kids should be thought to think critically, and to engage in dialogue. These are the kinds of skills that can be applied to careers in tech.</p>

  			<h3>When to Use Hashes in Ruby</h3>
  			<p>8/30/14</p>
  			<p>Hashes are similar in structure to arrays. Arrays are lists of things that look like this:</p>
			
			<pre>my_cool_array = [“Chuck”, 53, “tarantula”]</pre>
			
			<p>Hashes are also lists, but with a bit more complexity. Each item in a hash has two parts - the key (or index) and the value. This is what a hash looks like:</p>
			
			<pre>my_cool_hash = { “name” => “Chuck”, “age” => 53, “pet” => “tarantula” }</pre>
			
			<p>The additional complexity allows for a lot of cool things you can do with hashes that you wouldn’t be able to do with arrays.</p>
			
			<p>If I wanted to find “tarantula” in the array, I’d need to remember that I once put it at index 2 and make sure that I don’t accidentally rearrange the elements of my array. With a hash, I can access “tarantula” easily, without regard to what order the hash elements are in, if I put my_cool_hash[“pet”]. </p>
			
			<ol><li>Keeping count</li>
			
			<p>Let’s say you want to keep a count of the number of times a word appears in a block of text. You can use a hash to store a word as a key the first time it appears and then increment it’s value by 1 when the word appears again.</p>
			
			<p>This is how you would add the first instance of a word to the hash:</p>
			<pre>frequency_hash[“spelunking”] = 1</pre>
			
			<p>When it appears again, this is how you increase it’s value:</p>
			<pre>frequency_hash[“spelunking”] += 1</pre>
			
			<p>Then, once all the words have been counted, your hash might look something like this:</p>
			
			<pre>frequency_hash = { “spelunking” => 2, “is” => 4, “the” => 5 … }</pre>
			
			<p>And viola! You have a list of all the words in the text along with a count of how many times they appear.</p>
			
			<li>Making dictionaries and libraries</li>
			
			<p>Instead of assigning numbers as values, you can also assign strings or even other hashes. In this way you can build pretty complex data structures that are organized and easy to access.</p>
			
			<p>Here’s an example of how you could use a hash to store information about your library:</p>
			
			<pre>my_library = {<br>	“Pride and Prejudice” => { “author” => “Jane Austen”, “year” => 1813 }<br>	“War and Peace” => { “author” => “Leo Tolstoy”, “year” => 1869 }<br>	“Gorgias” => { “author” => “Plato”, “year” => -380 }<br>}</pre>
			
			<li>Pass in optional parameters to a method</li>
			
			<p>Sometimes you want a method to be able to accept optional parameters. One way to do this is to put an asterisk in front of the parameter that should be optional, like so:</p>
			
			<pre>def do_something_cool(mandatory, *optional)<br>	#<br>end</pre>
			
			<p>But you can also do it with a hash, like so:</p>
			
			<pre>def do_something_cool(mandatory, :option1 => true, :option2 => false})<br>	do ____ if options[:option1]<br>	do ____ if options[:option2]<br>end</pre></ol>
			
			<p>I’m sure there are other great applications of hashes, but this is all I have for you today.</p>
