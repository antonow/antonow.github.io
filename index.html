  			<h3>Asking the Right Questions</h3>
  			<p>10/5/2014</p>

			<p>What are questions? We all seem to know intuitively what they are. They are an articulation of something we don’t know, and, simultaneously, a request for assistance in finding an answer.</p>

			<p>Good questions target that which the asker knows that they do not know. There is a certain humility involved in asking good questions. You say, “This part I understand, but this, to me, is still confusing."</p>

			<p>Bad questions betray to the listener the asker’s ignorance of their own ignorance. I remember attending a lecture about the differences between transcendental and hermeneutic approaches to phenomenology, which went completely over my head, but at least I had the good sense of not asking any (probably) stupid questions. Another student, however, asked a totally incoherent question (regarding something about Jim Morrison and acid) that had nothing to do with anything that had been said. Even I couldn’t help feeling embarrassed for her.</p>

			<p>Bad questions are vague, confusingly put, and, at worst, completely incoherent. Good questions are the opposite. They demonstrate to the listener that the asker has studied the problem, isolated an impasse in their understanding, and articulated exactly what that is. Many times, in the process of narrowing down a question to formulate a good one, the question answers itself!</p>

			<p>I’ll end with several suggestions for formulating good questions.</p>

			<p>1. Do research first! Don’t waste people’s time asking questions that you can easily answer yourself.</p>
			<p>2. Be specific.</p>
			<p>3. Be humble. Be honest about what you don’t know. Don’t pretend to know more than you do because you might get a highly technical answer that presumes you already know the fundamentals.</p>

			<h3>3 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Quick, and Merge)</h3>
  			<p>9/28/14</p>
			
			<p>What is an algorithm? It is any set of instructions that a computer (or person) follows in order to achieve a desired solution.</p>

			<p>Studying algorithms is important because better algorithms make programs more efficient. Many times the data set that a program needs to interact with is very large. In order for the program to complete in a reasonable amount of time, you can upgrade the speed of the computer or come up with a more efficient algorithm. Upgrading the computer can be prohibitively expensive, but with a new algorithm you can get more mileage out of the same hardware.</p>

			<p>I want to look today at three different examples of sorting algorithms. The first algorithm is called bubble sort. It is a very basic sorting algorithm - one that anybody might come up with as an initial attempt at making a sorting algorithm. It works by going through the list of items to be sorted sequentially and comparing two adjacent values each time. The values then get swapped if they are in the wrong order.</p>

			<pre>________________________________<br>| 4 | 2 | 7 | 6 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 3 | (swap 4 and 2)<br>￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>________________________________<br>| 2 | 4 | 7 | 6 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 3 | (don’t swap 4 and 7)<br>￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>… (swap 6 and 7)<br>________________________________<br>| 2 | 4 | 6 | 7 | 1 | 5 | 9 | 3 | (swap 7 and 1)<br>￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>________________________________<br>| 2 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 9 | 3 | (swap 7 and 5)<br>￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>________________________________<br>| 2 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 5 | 7 | 9 | 3 | (don’t swap 7 and 9)<br>￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣<br>… (swap 9 and 3)<br>________________________________<br>| 2 | 4 | 6 | 1 | 5 | 7 | 3 | 9 | (result after 1st pass)<br>￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣￣</pre>

			<p>After the list has been iterated through once in this fashion, we iterate through it again and repeat the process until no swaps are made. Now we know that the list is ordered. This algorithm is very simple, but can take a very long time to execute. When it comes to algorithms, simplicity != efficiency.</p>

			<p>A faster sorting algorithm is merge sort. Merge sort uses a divide and conquer strategy. All the numbers are separated and evaluated in pairs, like this:</p>

			<pre>4  2  7  6  1  5  9  3<br><br>2  4<br>      6  7		  (divide into pairs)<br>            1  5<br>		  3  9<br><br>2  4  6  7		  (merge sorted couples and compare 1st values)<br>	    1  3  5  9	  <br><br>1  2			  (get 1 and 2)<br><br>      4  6  7 		  (compare 1st values)<br>	       3  5  9<br><br>1  2  3  4		  (get 3 and 4)<br><br>	    6  7          (compare 1st values, get 5 and 6)<br>	          5  9	  (compare 1st values, get 7 and 9)<br><br>1  2  3  4  5  6  7  9</pre>

			<p>Another algorithm that has a comparable efficiency to merge sort is quick sort. In quick sort, you pick any number as the “pivot" number and compare it to each other number in the list. The numbers get moved to the right or left depending on whether they are higher or lower than the pivot. At the end of one of these iterations, the pivot number is guaranteed to be in its correct final position.</p>
